            <h4>Rohtang Pass</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="container">
                <img src="assets/rohtang.jpg" alt="Place Image">

            <div>
                <br>
                <p>Rohtang Pass, at an altitude of 3979m (13,050 ft) above sea level, is another adventure tourist site where it can be cold even on a summer day. It is the highest point on the Manali-Keylong road and provides a wide panoramic view of mountains rising far above clouds, which is truly breath taking. Close by is a small lake called Dassaur Lake. Beas Kund, the source of river Beas, is also nearby. In winter, the road of Rothang Pass is closed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Important to note that the road to Rohtang Pass is closed off at Manali bridge, on all Tuesdays 09:00-18:00 for carrying out road widening work and repairs. If you are able to leave early, before 09:00, you can avoid the traffic rush (found on all other days) and have Rohtang Pass to your self (well almost!!). Flip side is to be prepared for stoppages (extending up to a few hours) on the return trip as the road is blocked off where repair works are progressed.</p>

            <h4>Hadimba Temple</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div>
                <br>
                <p>It is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, who was a character in the Indian epic, Mahābhārata.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The temple is surrounded by a beautiful cedar forest (Dhungri Van Vihar) at the foot of the Himālayas. The sanctuary is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground, which was worshipped as an image of the deity. The structure was built in the year 1553. If you're walking to the temple you can take a short cut up the hill through the woods instead of walking along the road. Look for two signs side by side with vertical Hindi writing on them (blue on the left, green on the right).</p>

            <h4>Solang Valley</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="container">

            <div>
                <br>
                <p>A mini valley located at about 8400 feet above sea level, Solang Nala is a short drive away from Manali. It is a haven for adventure and sports lovers and while here, you can try your skills on a pair of skis or go for a snowmobile exploration.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When the weather warms up, people flock here for zorbing and paragliding. You can also hop onto a cable car and enjoy mesmerizing views of the Himalayas. If you are looking for snow-based activities and sports, winters are the best time to visit while the months of summer are ideal for other adventure sports.</p>

            <h4>Jogini Falls</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div>
                <br>
                <p>The rushing cascades of Jogini Falls are a short and invigorating trek away from the main town of Manali. The trail that leads to the waterfall is scenic and gives you a glimpse of the River Beas and the snow-capped peaks of Rohtang.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Apart from the serene setting, Jogini is also an important place of pilgrimage and you can visit many old shrines around the pool at the bottom. An early start is recommended so that you can spend more time at this picturesque natural spot, which is one of the top trekking as well as picnic places in Manali.</p>

            <h4>The Manali Gompa</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">

            <div>
                <br>
                <p>The ornate design and the quintessential Tibetan architecture make the Gadhan Thekchhokling Gompa, more commonly referred to as the Manali Gompa, one of the finest landmarks in Manali. Built by Tibetan refugees in the 1960s, this monastery allows you to enjoy quiet settings and unmatched spiritual vibes.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>Some of the key highlights of the Manali Gompa include exquisite murals that depict important events of Buddhism in vivid colors and roofs built in the Pagoda style. The stalls in the complex are a good place to pick up some souvenirs and Tibetan handicraft items.</p>

            <h4>Bhrigu Lake</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div>
                <br>
                <p>Take a moment and think of postcard-perfect alpine meadows and evergreen tree forests near a serene high-altitude water body. Well, you have just now pictured Bhrigu Lake, one of the best trekking destinations around Manali.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A bit of acclimatization is needed if you are going for the trek as the lake is located more than 4000 meters above sea level. The scenery and panoramic views of the Pir Panjal Range are what draws most visitors to this place.</p>
